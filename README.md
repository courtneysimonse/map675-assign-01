## Data Sources

For this assignment we used data sets from a European country, the Netherlands.
The Netherlands is divided into the following administrative boundaries (Land-, Province- and Municipal borders). We used the administrative boundaries toghter with the railways and train stations. https://www.imergis.nl/htm/opendata.htm.
Shape files and geopackage were available. The geopackages were opened in QGIS and saved as shape files.
